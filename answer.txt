controller-A controller is a component in an MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure that
acts as the middle man between the Model and View. The controller's job is to take input 
from the user, retrieve data from the model, and then pass that data to the view for 
presentation to the user. The controller also passes any user input back to the model 
to update any necessary data.
